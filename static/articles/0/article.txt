CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS-- Continuing with its tradition of being the most prestigious college in America, Harvard University shocked the world this week by achieving a record-breaking low admissions rate of -2%. Long thought to be impossible by Ivy league admissions counselors all over the country, Harvard's revolutionary strategy of abducting, rejecting, and then murdering America’s orphans has given their admissions numbers the edge that they had been lacking in recent years.
	“The Harvard faith supports the assertion that anyone not moving forward is moving backward, and that attitude extends well into our admissions officers” stated William Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions. “We really needed a way to stick it to all those other dinky little ivys.”
	Known as the “contemporary Malthus”, Fitzsimmons has taken a harsh tone against critics of the program claiming that the blood of America’s orphans was “nourishing the brains of our students”. Despite criticism, Harvard law professors have found a way to make the program legal, and aim to expand it to include death row inmates in the killing process. 
	In response to Harvard’s success, Princeton and Stanford have now announced similar programs at their own college in the upcoming years.
