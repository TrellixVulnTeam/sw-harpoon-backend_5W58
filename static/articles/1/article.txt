The 2018 NHS board has announced a Forced Organ Harvesting campaign due to the lack of tickets sold for the Fall Fling. NHS President Izzie Mack announced over Email that the 2018 Board feels the need to actually do something meaningful this year unlike the board has done in previous years. Our inside sources say that because the sharp decline in the popularity of the Fall Fling, NHS has started to run out of funds and needs to find a new influx of money. The new Chair of Organ Harvesting Owen Dean declared that this drive will be the Most successful forced organ harvesting event in the tristate county. As a well-earned reward for participating (not that you have a choice), every participant will leave with a cookie, although they will also be lacking a kidney. This highly anticipated event is set to take place in the state of the art facility known as The Cove, which has been closed all of last year for this very event. So far it looks like this year's National Honor Society Board will actually do something for a change, even if it’s illegally taking people’s organs without their consent.
