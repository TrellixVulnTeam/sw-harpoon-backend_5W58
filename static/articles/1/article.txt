Yesterday--At 4pm standard Eastern Time Washington D.C was nuked off the map of the United States of America by Iran. In a video conference that was released worldwide the Iranian Government stated two reasons that caused this catastrophic loss of life; one was that it was retaliation for the way the white people of the United States treats everyone else in the world and two that they tried to display an act of mercy by getting rid of President Donald Trump.

The Iranian Government would of never been able to build this bomb if the United States hadn’t backed out of their deal made in 2014. All the other governments and International organizations tried to warn Trump that this would enable World War Three and prove that the United States never holds their word on anything like with Native Americans.
