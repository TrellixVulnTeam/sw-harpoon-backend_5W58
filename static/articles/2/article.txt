After the release of the first prequel to the Purge Horror Series last Fourth of July weekend Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced at yesterday’s White House press briefing that since Trump saw it well on his weekend guling instead of governing thought the heroes of the movie were true Americans. To clarify Trump said that the Klu Klux Klansmen and the White Supremacists as the heroes of the Movie. 

A quote taken from Trump’s interview with Ron Burgundy this morning has him saying this about the Movie, The First Purge, “I really felt this heroic war movie was one of the best I’ve seen because none of it was false. It was Almost as good as the fresh McDonald’s I get from the secret service after every speech I feel like the heroes of the film had a great idea, The Founding Fathers.” To honor the fallen heroes within the film’s story Trump has decided to enact a similar program starting in 2019 and introducing it to congress after the 2018 elections.This Genocide Program will be one of the crowning achievements of Trump’s first term in office.

This whole response started because of the very credible threat of chemical warefare that the gays and liberals own. Trump himself knows it to be true, despite never being briefed on it by government officals, because he saw it Alex Jones and Fox Nightly News. A straw poll by CNN said that people couldn’t tell the difference between the mission statement for the the new program and the goals of Hitler’s Holocaust.  In unrelated news Trump will be prosecuted by the United Nations if he decides to enact the plan.
