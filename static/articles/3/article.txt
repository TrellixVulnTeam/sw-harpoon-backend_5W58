On April 20th 2018 Chuckles Mcgee, a student at Southwest High School, broke the world record of longest high previously held by Clover BongToker who snatched the record from Bud Cinna Blunts in 1989. The official time was recorded by Master Expert Snoop Dogg during the Weed Olympics this year which took place in Garry’s Mom’s basement. The previous record of 127 hours was shattered by Chuckles’ 420 hour long high. We were fortunate enough to interview Chuckles’ parents to discuss how he achieved this amazing feat of staying high for 420 hours.

Interviewer
Mr. and Mrs. Mcgee, how proud are you of your son for accomplishing something no one else in the world has managed to achieve?

Mr. Mcgee
We so blessed to have a son who is this talented and persistent. We had thought that our son was just a stoner who accomplished nothing with his life, but when he told us of his goal we supported him full-heartedly. He trained by smoking or eating 20 grams of weed every day right after he got up at 4 in the afternoon.

Interviewer
Can I ask what exact training routine and diet he used to become one of the leading experts on smoking cannabis?

Mrs. Mcgee
He called his main diet plan “The Munchies”. It was pretty much equal to what an Olympic Athlete would eat (4000 calories/day) except without exercising.

Interviewer
How did both of you feel when he got into the 2018 Weed Olympics?

Mr. and Mrs. Mcgee
Oh my goodness, we were both so proud!!!

Mr. Mcgee
I was even prouder for him than I was when his brother, Richard III, got full rides to Yale, Brown, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania, and then went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize for Medicine.

Interviewer
Thank you for your time.I will see myself out.

Ten weeks after leaving the Mcgees’ house the interviewer still hasn’t been able to wash the stench of cannabis from his clothes.
