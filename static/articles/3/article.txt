Washington DC, VA-With the United States Midterm elections quickly approaching Russia has offered President Trump to oversee all election results. Putin, himself has agreed to become an Election Judge along with 2000 of his fellow countrymen. Trump stated in a recent press conference that Putin promised him that he is trying to make amends for the Russian Hacking in the 2016 election. Unfortunately there is no one else that can confirm this statement since it was just Trump, Putin, and the Translators in the room alone.

After backpedaling his earlier statements, Trump has now repealed and agreed to let Russia help investigate the 2016 Russian Election hack. Putin will be flying in a month before to also help integrate the KGB and FBI for the joint investigation. Putin has promised that the United States after these elections will closely resemble the Mother Russia. 

A week after Putin spending time within Washington DC he will travel to Minnesota to become an election judge in the great city of Minneapolis. Putin is determined to show the people of the United States of America that he is an actually human being and not just a terrible sociopath.
