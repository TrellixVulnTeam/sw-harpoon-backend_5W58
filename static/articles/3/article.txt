MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA-- The beginning of the school year marks the start of classes, after-school activities, and most importantly, the administration's new unique attempts to quell even the most reasonable behavior out of students. This year, after having observed no positive effects from implementing hall sweeps and locking bathrooms during 2017, Sean Flandrick announced that Southwest High School would become home to the world’s first ultra-intelligent robot designed to harm, not help. 
	Staying true to Southwest’s defining policy of, “literally anything except rational and beneficial actions”, students late to class can now expect to receive personalized punishments from the new and improved tardy machines.
	“The beauty of this new A.I. is that it can target students both physically and emotionally,” stated Priya Barsar, the lead developer. “With unlimited access to school database records, the tardy machines know which students have asthma, allergies, weak legs, etc., as well as if they are currently receiving treatment for a number of mental health conditions, such as depression, phobias, or anxiety.”
	Although some parents have questioned the goal of these new costly upgrades, Southwest administration has remained firmly in favor of the bots and claims the savings observed from being able to damage students physically and emotionally in the most effective way possible will outweigh any short-term costs. When asked if the machines would ever kill, staff responded, “if a student is 10-seconds late to class I would question their motives and willingness to live in the first place.”
