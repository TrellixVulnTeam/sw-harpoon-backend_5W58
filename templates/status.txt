what I did tonight:
made the main server side part of the app
decided how we are going to structure the backend
integrated form validation and login for submitting articles

what to do this week:
finish the add article protocol(generating id, adding to correct folders)
finish the add category protocol(generate folder)
finish the remove article protocol(remove from all folders, free id)
finish the remove category protocol(remove from all articles, delete folder)
populate the database

long term:
create protocol to receive articles from server
create smart searching protocol
make it look sexy
